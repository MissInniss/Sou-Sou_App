        <h3>## what ?</h3>

        A Susu (AKA Sou-Sou or su-su) is a community-style savings practice. A group of people help each other
        achieve their savings goals by pooling their money together.<br />
        <br />
        A popular savings practice in African, Caribbean and even some Asian cultures, a Susu encourages friends and
        family to build wealth together.<br />
        <br />
        Each member contributes an equal amount of money at a set period of time. Then they receive the lump sum of
        every contribution at least once. As one of the oldest types of savings clubs, the Susu savings approach
        helps fund each person’s financial goals over time.

            ## How ?</h3>

            A Susu is a rotational savings practice where a group of family members or friends contribute an equal
            amount of
            money, popularly known as a “hand,” on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis for a set of time.

            So, one member of the group will get to collect the full lump sum each time until everyone gets their turn
            to
            disperse, known as a “draw'". The terms of the amount of each contribution, the length of time, and the
            schedule
            for who gets to disperse when is agreed on as a group.

            For example, let's say a family of five starts a Susu, where each week for five weeks, each member of the
            family
            contributes $100. Each week, one family member collects the full $500, while every person puts in $100 again
            until the fifth and last week. Everyone contributes equally and gets the full amount once.
